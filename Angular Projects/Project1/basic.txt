1.Add a button which says "Display Details"
2.Add a paragraph with any content of your choice(Eg: 'Secret Password=tuna')
3.Toggle the displaying of this paragraph with the click of the button created in the 1st step
4.Log all button clicks in an array and output that array below the paragraph(maybe log simply an incrementing number)
5.Starting at the 5th log item, give all the future log items a blue background color and a white (text) color
